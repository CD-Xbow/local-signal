# Local Signal
This is a build of Signal, which is a user-friendly music sequencer application developed using web technology, designed for seamless, cross-platform use. See  https://github.com/ryohey/signal

While it's user friendly, it certainly wasn't friendly to build and deploy. 

Pain and suffering. Much pain and suffering. 

Eventually I managed to get this build working, one which is hopefully, easy to deploy.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure accessibility across various devices and operating systems.
- **Simple User Interface:** Focus on an intuitive, non-complicated user interface for ease of use.
- **MIDI Compatibility:** Support for MIDI format to facilitate a wide range of music production needs.
- **Easy to install:** I hope so.

## Setup Instructions

A. This distribution works locally on a PC with NPM installed by running the command

 ### npx http-server dist

I will try other small, local servers and see if it works

B, This distribution works fine on proper web servers as is - see https://teamxbow.web.fc2.com/site/music/signal/index.html
